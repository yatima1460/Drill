 * worse instead of better (the semantics should be considered

 * should return a useful error to the program. You are advised to use
 * XGetWindowProperty() directly until a replacement function for
 * gdk_property_get() is provided.

 *     type = the desired property type, or %GDK_NONE, if any type of data

 *         be filled in, a warning will be printed to stderr
 *         and no data will be returned.
 *     offset = the offset into the property at which to begin
 *         retrieving data, in 4 byte units.
 *     length = the length of the data to retrieve in bytes.  Data is
 *         considered to be retrieved in 4 byte chunks, so @length
 *         will be rounded up to the next highest 4 byte boundary
 *         (so be careful not to pass a value that might overflow
 *         when rounded up).
 *     pdelete = if %TRUE, delete the property after retrieving the
 *         data.
 *     actualPropertyType = location to store the
 *         actual type of the property.
 *     actualFormat = location to store the actual return format of the
 *         data; either 8, 16 or 32 bits.
 *     data = location
 *         to store a pointer to the data. The retrieved data should be
