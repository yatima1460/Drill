/**
 * The #GdkGeometry struct gives the window manager information about
 * a window’s geometry constraints. Normally you would set these on
 * the GTK+ level using gtk_window_set_geometry_hints(). #GtkWindow
 * then sets the hints on the #GdkWindow it creates.
 *
 * gdk_window_set_geometry_hints() expects the hints to be fully valid already
 * and simply passes them to the window manager; in contrast,
 * gtk_window_set_geometry_hints() performs some interpretation. For example,
 * #GtkWindow will apply the hints to the geometry widget instead of the
 * toplevel window, if you set a geometry widget. Also, the
 * @min_width/@min_height/@max_width/@max_height fields may be set to -1, and
 * #GtkWindow will substitute the size request of the window or geometry widget.
 * If the minimum size hint is not provided, #GtkWindow will use its requisition
 * as the minimum size. If the minimum size is provided and a geometry widget is
 * set, #GtkWindow will take the minimum size as the minimum size of the
 * geometry widget rather than the entire window. The base size is treated
 * similarly.
 *
 * The canonical use-case for gtk_window_set_geometry_hints() is to get a
 * terminal widget to resize properly. Here, the terminal text area should be
 * the geometry widget; #GtkWindow will then automatically set the base size to
 * the size of other widgets in the terminal window, such as the menubar and
 * scrollbar. Then, the @width_inc and @height_inc fields should be set to the
 * size of one character in the terminal. Finally, the base size should be set
 * to the size of one character. The net effect is that the minimum size of the
 * terminal will have a 1x1 character terminal area, and only terminal sizes on
 * the “character grid” will be allowed.
 *
 * Here’s an example of how the terminal example would be implemented, assuming
 * a terminal area widget called “terminal” and a toplevel window “toplevel”:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * GdkGeometry hints;
 *
 * hints.base_width = terminal->char_width;
 * hints.base_height = terminal->char_height;
 * hints.min_width = terminal->char_width;
 * hints.min_height = terminal->char_height;
 * hints.width_inc = terminal->char_width;
 * hints.height_inc = terminal->char_height;
 *
 * gtk_window_set_geometry_hints (GTK_WINDOW (toplevel),
 * GTK_WIDGET (terminal),
 * &hints,
 * GDK_HINT_RESIZE_INC |
 * GDK_HINT_MIN_SIZE |
 * GDK_HINT_BASE_SIZE);
 * ]|
 *
 * The other useful fields are the @min_aspect and @max_aspect fields; these
 * contain a width/height ratio as a floating point number. If a geometry widget
 * is set, the aspect applies to the geometry widget rather than the entire
 * window. The most common use of these hints is probably to set @min_aspect and
 * @max_aspect to the same value, thus forcing the window to keep a constant
 * aspect ratio.
