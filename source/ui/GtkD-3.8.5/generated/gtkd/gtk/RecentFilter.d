/**
 * A #GtkRecentFilter can be used to restrict the files being shown
 * in a #GtkRecentChooser.  Files can be filtered based on their name
 * (with gtk_recent_filter_add_pattern()), on their mime type (with
 * gtk_file_filter_add_mime_type()), on the application that has
 * registered them (with gtk_recent_filter_add_application()), or by
 * a custom filter function (with gtk_recent_filter_add_custom()).
 * 
 * Filtering by mime type handles aliasing and subclassing of mime
 * types; e.g. a filter for text/plain also matches a file with mime
 * type application/rtf, since application/rtf is a subclass of text/plain.
 * Note that #GtkRecentFilter allows wildcards for the subtype of a
 * mime type, so you can e.g. filter for image/\*.
 * 
 * Normally, filters are used by adding them to a #GtkRecentChooser,
 * see gtk_recent_chooser_add_filter(), but it is also possible to
 * manually use a filter on a file with gtk_recent_filter_filter().
 * 
 * Recently used files are supported since GTK+ 2.10.
 * 
 * ## GtkRecentFilter as GtkBuildable
 * 
 * The GtkRecentFilter implementation of the GtkBuildable interface
 * supports adding rules using the <mime-types>, <patterns> and
 * <applications> elements and listing the rules within. Specifying
 * a <mime-type>, <pattern> or <application> has the same effect as
 * calling gtk_recent_filter_add_mime_type(),
 * gtk_recent_filter_add_pattern() or gtk_recent_filter_add_application().
 * 
 * An example of a UI definition fragment specifying GtkRecentFilter rules:
 * |[
 * <object class="GtkRecentFilter">
 * <mime-types>
 * <mime-type>text/plain</mime-type>
 * <mime-type>image/png</mime-type>
 * </mime-types>
 * <patterns>
 * <pattern>*.txt</pattern>
 * <pattern>*.png</pattern>
 * </patterns>
 * <applications>
 * <application>gimp</application>
 * <application>gedit</application>
 * <application>glade</application>
 * </applications>
 * </object>
 * ]|
