	 * 1. Compress enter/leave notify events. If the event passed build an

	 *
	 * 3. Then the event is pushed onto a stack so you can query the currently
	 * handled event with gtk_get_current_event().
	 *
	 * 4. The event is sent to a widget. If a grab is active all events for widgets
	 * that are not in the contained in the grab widget are sent to the latter
	 * with a few exceptions:
	 * - Deletion and destruction events are still sent to the event widget for
	 * obvious reasons.
	 * - Events which directly relate to the visual representation of the event
	 * widget.
	 * - Leave events are delivered to the event widget if there was an enter
	 * event delivered to it before without the paired leave event.
	 * - Drag events are not redirected because it is unclear what the semantics
	 * of that would be.
	 * Another point of interest might be that all key events are first passed
	 * through the key snooper functions if there are any. Read the description
	 * of gtk_key_snooper_install() if you need this feature.
