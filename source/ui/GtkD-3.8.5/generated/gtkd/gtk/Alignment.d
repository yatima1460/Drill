/**
 * The #GtkAlignment widget controls the alignment and size of its child widget.
 * It has four settings: xscale, yscale, xalign, and yalign.
 * 
 * The scale settings are used to specify how much the child widget should
 * expand to fill the space allocated to the #GtkAlignment.
 * The values can range from 0 (meaning the child doesnâ€™t expand at all) to
 * 1 (meaning the child expands to fill all of the available space).
 * 
 * The align settings are used to place the child widget within the available
 * area. The values range from 0 (top or left) to 1 (bottom or right).
 * Of course, if the scale settings are both set to 1, the alignment settings
 * have no effect.
 * 
 * GtkAlignment has been deprecated in 3.14 and should not be used in
 * newly-written code. The desired effect can be achieved by using the
 * #GtkWidget:halign, #GtkWidget:valign and #GtkWidget:margin properties on the
 * child widget.
