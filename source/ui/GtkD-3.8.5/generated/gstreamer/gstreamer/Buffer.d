/**
 * Buffers are the basic unit of data transfer in GStreamer. They contain the
 * timing and offset along with other arbitrary metadata that is associated
 * with the #GstMemory blocks that the buffer contains.
 * 
 * Buffers are usually created with gst_buffer_new(). After a buffer has been
 * created one will typically allocate memory for it and add it to the buffer.
 * The following example creates a buffer that can hold a given video frame
 * with a given width, height and bits per plane.
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * GstBuffer *buffer;
 * GstMemory *memory;
 * gint size, width, height, bpp;
 * ...
 * size = width * height * bpp;
 * buffer = gst_buffer_new ();
 * memory = gst_allocator_alloc (NULL, size, NULL);
 * gst_buffer_insert_memory (buffer, -1, memory);
 * ...
 * ]|
 * 
 * Alternatively, use gst_buffer_new_allocate() to create a buffer with
 * preallocated data of a given size.
 * 
 * Buffers can contain a list of #GstMemory objects. You can retrieve how many
 * memory objects with gst_buffer_n_memory() and you can get a pointer
 * to memory with gst_buffer_peek_memory()
 * 
 * A buffer will usually have timestamps, and a duration, but neither of these
 * are guaranteed (they may be set to #GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE). Whenever a
 * meaningful value can be given for these, they should be set. The timestamps
 * and duration are measured in nanoseconds (they are #GstClockTime values).
 * 
 * The buffer DTS refers to the timestamp when the buffer should be decoded and
 * is usually monotonically increasing. The buffer PTS refers to the timestamp when
 * the buffer content should be presented to the user and is not always
 * monotonically increasing.
 * 
 * A buffer can also have one or both of a start and an end offset. These are
 * media-type specific. For video buffers, the start offset will generally be
 * the frame number. For audio buffers, it will be the number of samples
 * produced so far. For compressed data, it could be the byte offset in a
 * source or destination file. Likewise, the end offset will be the offset of
 * the end of the buffer. These can only be meaningfully interpreted if you
 * know the media type of the buffer (the preceding CAPS event). Either or both
 * can be set to #GST_BUFFER_OFFSET_NONE.
 * 
 * gst_buffer_ref() is used to increase the refcount of a buffer. This must be
 * done when you want to keep a handle to the buffer after pushing it to the
 * next element. The buffer refcount determines the writability of the buffer, a
 * buffer is only writable when the refcount is exactly 1, i.e. when the caller
 * has the only reference to the buffer.
 * 
 * To efficiently create a smaller buffer out of an existing one, you can
 * use gst_buffer_copy_region(). This method tries to share the memory objects
 * between the two buffers.
 * 
 * If a plug-in wants to modify the buffer data or metadata in-place, it should
 * first obtain a buffer that is safe to modify by using
 * gst_buffer_make_writable().  This function is optimized so that a copy will
 * only be made when it is necessary.
 * 
 * Several flags of the buffer can be set and unset with the
 * GST_BUFFER_FLAG_SET() and GST_BUFFER_FLAG_UNSET() macros. Use
 * GST_BUFFER_FLAG_IS_SET() to test if a certain #GstBufferFlags flag is set.
 * 
 * Buffers can be efficiently merged into a larger buffer with
 * gst_buffer_append(). Copying of memory will only be done when absolutely
 * needed.
 * 
 * Arbitrary extra metadata can be set on a buffer with gst_buffer_add_meta().
 * Metadata can be retrieved with gst_buffer_get_meta(). See also #GstMeta
 * 
 * An element should either unref the buffer or push it out on a src pad
 * using gst_pad_push() (see #GstPad).
 * 
 * Buffers are usually freed by unreffing them with gst_buffer_unref(). When
 * the refcount drops to 0, any memory and metadata pointed to by the buffer is
 * unreffed as well. Buffers allocated from a #GstBufferPool will be returned to
 * the pool when the refcount drops to 0.
 * 
 * The #GstParentBufferMeta is a meta which can be attached to a #GstBuffer
 * to hold a reference to another buffer that is only released when the child
 * #GstBuffer is released.
 * 
 * Typically, #GstParentBufferMeta is used when the child buffer is directly
 * using the #GstMemory of the parent buffer, and wants to prevent the parent
 * buffer from being returned to a buffer pool until the #GstMemory is available
 * for re-use. (Since 1.6)
