/**
 * This interface offers methods to query and manipulate parameter preset sets.
 * A preset is a bunch of property settings, together with meta data and a name.
 * The name of a preset serves as key for subsequent method calls to manipulate
 * single presets.
 * All instances of one type will share the list of presets. The list is created
 * on demand, if presets are not used, the list is not created.
 * 
 * The interface comes with a default implementation that serves most plugins.
 * Wrapper plugins will override most methods to implement support for the
 * native preset format of those wrapped plugins.
 * One method that is useful to be overridden is gst_preset_get_property_names().
 * With that one can control which properties are saved and in which order.
 * When implementing support for read-only presets, one should set the vmethods
 * for gst_preset_save_preset() and gst_preset_delete_preset() to %NULL.
 * Applications can use gst_preset_is_editable() to check for that.
 * 
 * The default implementation supports presets located in a system directory,
 * application specific directory and in the users home directory. When getting
 * a list of presets individual presets are read and overlaid in 1) system,
 * 2) application and 3) user order. Whenever an earlier entry is newer, the
 * later entries will be updated. Since 1.8 you can also provide extra paths
 * where to find presets through the GST_PRESET_PATH environment variable.
 * Presets found in those paths will be concidered as "app presets".
