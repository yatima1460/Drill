/**
 * A #GstPoll keeps track of file descriptors much like fd_set (used with
 * select()) or a struct pollfd array (used with poll()). Once created with
 * gst_poll_new(), the set can be used to wait for file descriptors to be
 * readable and/or writable. It is possible to make this wait be controlled
 * by specifying %TRUE for the @controllable flag when creating the set (or
 * later calling gst_poll_set_controllable()).
 * 
 * New file descriptors are added to the set using gst_poll_add_fd(), and
 * removed using gst_poll_remove_fd(). Controlling which file descriptors
 * should be waited for to become readable and/or writable are done using
 * gst_poll_fd_ctl_read() and gst_poll_fd_ctl_write().
 * 
 * Use gst_poll_wait() to wait for the file descriptors to actually become
 * readable and/or writable, or to timeout if no file descriptor is available
 * in time. The wait can be controlled by calling gst_poll_restart() and
 * gst_poll_set_flushing().
 * 
 * Once the file descriptor set has been waited for, one can use
 * gst_poll_fd_has_closed() to see if the file descriptor has been closed,
 * gst_poll_fd_has_error() to see if it has generated an error,
 * gst_poll_fd_can_read() to see if it is possible to read from the file
 * descriptor, and gst_poll_fd_can_write() to see if it is possible to
 * write to it.
