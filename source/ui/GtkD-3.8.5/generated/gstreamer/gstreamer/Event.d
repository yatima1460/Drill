/**
 * The event class provides factory methods to construct events for sending
 * and functions to query (parse) received events.
 * 
 * Events are usually created with gst_event_new_*() which takes event-type
 * specific parameters as arguments.
 * To send an event application will usually use gst_element_send_event() and
 * elements will use gst_pad_send_event() or gst_pad_push_event().
 * The event should be unreffed with gst_event_unref() if it has not been sent.
 * 
 * Events that have been received can be parsed with their respective
 * gst_event_parse_*() functions. It is valid to pass %NULL for unwanted details.
 * 
 * Events are passed between elements in parallel to the data stream. Some events
 * are serialized with buffers, others are not. Some events only travel downstream,
 * others only upstream. Some events can travel both upstream and downstream.
 * 
 * The events are used to signal special conditions in the datastream such as
 * EOS (end of stream) or the start of a new stream-segment.
 * Events are also used to flush the pipeline of any pending data.
 * 
 * Most of the event API is used inside plugins. Applications usually only
 * construct and use seek events.
 * To do that gst_event_new_seek() is used to create a seek event. It takes
 * the needed parameters to specify seeking time and mode.
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * GstEvent *event;
 * gboolean result;

 * // construct a seek event to play the media from second 2 to 5, flush
 * // the pipeline to decrease latency.

	 * element to either reduce or increase its rate because of
	 * high/low CPU load or other resource usage such as network performance or
	 * throttling. Typically sinks generate these events for each buffer
	 * they receive.
	 *
	 * @type indicates the reason for the QoS event. #GST_QOS_TYPE_OVERFLOW is
	 * used when a buffer arrived in time or when the sink cannot keep up with
	 * the upstream datarate. #GST_QOS_TYPE_UNDERFLOW is when the sink is not
	 * receiving buffers fast enough and thus has to drop late buffers.
	 * #GST_QOS_TYPE_THROTTLE is used when the datarate is artificially limited
	 * by the application, for example to reduce power consumption.
	 *
	 * @proportion indicates the real-time performance of the streaming in the
	 * element that generated the QoS event (usually the sink). The value is
	 * generally computed based on more long term statistics about the streams
	 * timestamps compared to the clock.
	 * A value < 1.0 indicates that the upstream element is producing data faster
	 * than real-time. A value > 1.0 indicates that the upstream element is not
	 * producing data fast enough. 1.0 is the ideal @proportion value. The
	 * proportion value can safely be used to lower or increase the quality of
	 * the element.
	 *
	 * @diff is the difference against the clock in running time of the last
	 * buffer that caused the element to generate the QOS event. A negative value
	 * means that the buffer with @timestamp arrived in time. A positive value
	 * indicates how late the buffer with @timestamp was. When throttling is
	 * enabled, @diff will be set to the requested throttling interval.
	 *
	 * @timestamp is the timestamp of the last buffer that cause the element
	 * to generate the QOS event. It is expressed in running time and thus an ever
	 * increasing value.
	 *
	 * The upstream element can use the @diff and @timestamp values to decide
	 * whether to process more buffers. For positive @diff, all buffers with
	 * timestamp <= @timestamp + @diff will certainly arrive late in the sink
	 * as well. A (negative) @diff value so that @timestamp + @diff would yield a
