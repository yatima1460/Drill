/**
 * #GstBaseSink is the base class for sink elements in GStreamer, such as
 * xvimagesink or filesink. It is a layer on top of #GstElement that provides a
 * simplified interface to plugin writers. #GstBaseSink handles many details
 * for you, for example: preroll, clock synchronization, state changes,
 * activation in push or pull mode, and queries.
 * 
 * In most cases, when writing sink elements, there is no need to implement
 * class methods from #GstElement or to set functions on pads, because the
 * #GstBaseSink infrastructure should be sufficient.
 * 
 * #GstBaseSink provides support for exactly one sink pad, which should be
 * named "sink". A sink implementation (subclass of #GstBaseSink) should
 * install a pad template in its class_init function, like so:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * static void
 * my_element_class_init (GstMyElementClass *klass)
 * {
 * GstElementClass *gstelement_class = GST_ELEMENT_CLASS (klass);
 * 
 * // sinktemplate should be a #GstStaticPadTemplate with direction
 * // %GST_PAD_SINK and name "sink"
 * gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template (gstelement_class, &amp;sinktemplate);
 * 
 * gst_element_class_set_static_metadata (gstelement_class,
 * "Sink name",
 * "Sink",
 * "My Sink element",
 * "The author <my.sink@my.email>");
 * }
 * ]|
 * 
 * #GstBaseSink will handle the prerolling correctly. This means that it will
 * return %GST_STATE_CHANGE_ASYNC from a state change to PAUSED until the first
 * buffer arrives in this element. The base class will call the
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.preroll() vmethod with this preroll buffer and will then
 * commit the state change to the next asynchronously pending state.
 * 
 * When the element is set to PLAYING, #GstBaseSink will synchronise on the
 * clock using the times returned from #GstBaseSinkClass.get_times(). If this
 * function returns %GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE for the start time, no synchronisation
 * will be done. Synchronisation can be disabled entirely by setting the object
 * #GstBaseSink:sync property to %FALSE.
 * 
 * After synchronisation the virtual method #GstBaseSinkClass.render() will be
 * called. Subclasses should minimally implement this method.
 * 
 * Subclasses that synchronise on the clock in the #GstBaseSinkClass.render()
 * method are supported as well. These classes typically receive a buffer in
 * the render method and can then potentially block on the clock while
 * rendering. A typical example is an audiosink.
 * These subclasses can use gst_base_sink_wait_preroll() to perform the
 * blocking wait.
 * 
 * Upon receiving the EOS event in the PLAYING state, #GstBaseSink will wait
 * for the clock to reach the time indicated by the stop time of the last
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.get_times() call before posting an EOS message. When the
 * element receives EOS in PAUSED, preroll completes, the event is queued and an
 * EOS message is posted when going to PLAYING.
 * 
 * #GstBaseSink will internally use the %GST_EVENT_SEGMENT events to schedule
 * synchronisation and clipping of buffers. Buffers that fall completely outside
 * of the current segment are dropped. Buffers that fall partially in the
 * segment are rendered (and prerolled). Subclasses should do any subbuffer
 * clipping themselves when needed.
 * 
 * #GstBaseSink will by default report the current playback position in
 * %GST_FORMAT_TIME based on the current clock time and segment information.
 * If no clock has been set on the element, the query will be forwarded
 * upstream.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSinkClass.set_caps() function will be called when the subclass
 * should configure itself to process a specific media type.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSinkClass.start() and #GstBaseSinkClass.stop() virtual methods
 * will be called when resources should be allocated. Any
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.preroll(), #GstBaseSinkClass.render() and
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.set_caps() function will be called between the
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.start() and #GstBaseSinkClass.stop() calls.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSinkClass.event() virtual method will be called when an event is
 * received by #GstBaseSink. Normally this method should only be overridden by
 * very specific elements (such as file sinks) which need to handle the
 * newsegment event specially.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSinkClass.unlock() method is called when the elements should
 * unblock any blocking operations they perform in the
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.render() method. This is mostly useful when the
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.render() method performs a blocking write on a file
 * descriptor, for example.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSink:max-lateness property affects how the sink deals with
 * buffers that arrive too late in the sink. A buffer arrives too late in the
 * sink when the presentation time (as a combination of the last segment, buffer
 * timestamp and element base_time) plus the duration is before the current
 * time of the clock.
 * If the frame is later than max-lateness, the sink will drop the buffer
 * without calling the render method.
 * This feature is disabled if sync is disabled, the
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.get_times() method does not return a valid start time or
 * max-lateness is set to -1 (the default).
 * Subclasses can use gst_base_sink_set_max_lateness() to configure the
 * max-lateness value.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSink:qos property will enable the quality-of-service features of
 * the basesink which gather statistics about the real-time performance of the
 * clock synchronisation. For each buffer received in the sink, statistics are
 * gathered and a QOS event is sent upstream with these numbers. This
 * information can then be used by upstream elements to reduce their processing
 * rate, for example.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSink:async property can be used to instruct the sink to never
 * perform an ASYNC state change. This feature is mostly usable when dealing
 * with non-synchronized streams or sparse streams.
