	 * the stripped data stream before adding their own source pad (the specified
	 * callback can then call the upstream peer pad with offsets adjusted for the
	 * tag size, for example).
	 *
	 * When @extension is not %NULL, this function will first try the typefind
	 * functions for the given extension, which might speed up the typefinding
	 * in many cases.

	 * Free-function: gst_caps_unref
	 *
	 * Params:
	 *     obj = A #GstObject that will be passed as first argument to @func
	 *     parent = the parent of @obj or %NULL
	 *     func = A generic #GstTypeFindHelperGetRangeFunction that will
