	 * Use this function to escape the following characters: `\n`, `\r`, `\t` and `\`.
	 *
	 * For a regular expression search, use g_regex_escape_string() instead.
	 *
	 * One possible use case is to take the #GtkTextBuffer's selection and put it in a
	 * search entry. The selection can contain tabulations, newlines, etc. So it's
	 * better to escape those special characters to better fit in the search entry.
	 *
	 * See also: gtk_source_utils_unescape_search_text().
	 *
	 * <warning>
	 * Warning: the escape and unescape functions are not reciprocal! For example,
	 * escape (unescape (\)) = \\. So avoid cycles such as: search entry -> unescape
	 * -> search settings -> escape -> search entry. The original search entry text
	 * may be modified.
	 * </warning>

	 * Params:
	 *     text = the text to escape.
	 *
	 * Returns: the escaped @text.
