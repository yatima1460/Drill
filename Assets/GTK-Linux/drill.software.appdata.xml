	<summary>Search files without indexing, but clever crawling</summary>
	<description>
		<p>At least 1 thread per mount point.
Use as much RAM as possible for caching stuff.
Try to avoid "black hole folders" using a regex based blocklist in which the crawler will never come out and never scan useful files (node_modules,Windows,etc).
Intended for desktop users, no obscure Linux files and system files scans.
Use priority lists to first scan important folders.
Betting on the future: slowly being optimized for SSDs/M.2 or fast RAID arrays.</p>
