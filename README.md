# TL;DR: What is this

Search files without indexing, but clever crawling:
- At least 1 thread per mount point
- Use as much RAM as possible for caching stuff
- Try to avoid "black hole folders" using a regex based blocklist in which the crawler will never come out and never scan useful files (`node_modules`,`Windows`,etc)
- **Intended for desktop users**, no obscure Linux files and system files scans
- Use priority lists to first scan important folders.
- Betting on the future: slowly being optimized for SSDs/M.2 or fast RAID arrays

# How to run this

**Use the provided AppImage, just double click it**

If your distro doesn't ask you to mark it executable or nothing happens try:
- `chmod +x Drill.AppImage`
- `./Drill.AppImage`

# UI Guide

- Open                    = Left Double Click / Return / Enter / Space
- ~~Open containing folder  = Right click~~



# Build and Run

**Some dependencies don't build with GDC!!!**
**Use DMD or LDC!!!**

## Manual prerequisites

- The repo, remember to clone the submodules too with:
    - `git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/yatima1460/Drill.git`
- D
    - `curl -fsS https://dlang.org/install.sh | bash -s dmd`

### Configurations available (in dub.json)

- CLI
- GTK
- ~~Win~~
- ~~MacOS~~
- ~~ncurses~~

### Debug
```
dub run -c CONFIGURATION_NAME
```

### Release (no logs and faster)
```
dub run -c CONFIGURATION_NAME -b release
```

# What is this

I was stressed on Linux because I couldn't find the files I needed, file searchers based on system indexing (updatedb) are prone to breaking and hard to configure for the average user, so did an all nighter and started this.

Drill is a modern file searcher for Linux that tries to fix the old problem of slow searching and indexing.
Nowadays even some SSDs are used for storage and every PC has nearly a minimum of 8GB of RAM and quad-core;
knowing this it's time to design a future-proof file searcher that doesn't care about weak systems and uses the full multithreaded power in a clever way to find your files in the fastest possible way.

* Heuristics:
The first change was the algorithm, a lot of file searchers use depth-first algorithms, this is a very stupid choice and everyone that implemented it is a moron, why? 
You see, normal humans don't create nested folders too much and you will probably get lost inside "black hole folders" or artificial archives (created by software); a breadth-first algorithm that scans your hard disks by depth has a higher chance to find the files you need.
Second change is excluding some obvious folders while crawling like `Windows` and `node_modules`, the average user doesn't care about .dlls and all the system files, and generally even devs too don't care, and if you need to find a system file you already know what you are doing and you should not use a UI tool.

* Clever multithreading: The second change is clever multithreading, I've never seen a file searcher that starts a thread *per disk* and it's 2019. The limitation for file searchers is 99% of the time just the disk speed, not the CPU or RAM, then why everyone just scans the disks sequentially????

* Use your goddamn RAM: The third change is caching everything, I don't care about your RAM, I will use even 8GB of your RAM if this provides me a faster way to find your files, unused RAM is wasted RAM, even truer the more time passes.
